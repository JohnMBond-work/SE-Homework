				I am fascinated by many different religeous beliefs and phylosophies as well as the history of them.  I was raised Baptist but have attended synoaogue a few times and have a special love for judaism and its history.  I would like to someday attend mosque and Catholic mass for the experiences.

				I am a Linux geek.  I have been using Linux exclusively for almost 20 years now.  I run it on older hardware so I dont need the newest, fastest machine to run it, unlike Windows does in order to run well enough.  I dont have to worry about catching a virus on my machine.  I like to think that I can do just about anything. I am willing to learn so I like tinkering with the Linux configuration files, just to see how it works.  It is freedom.  In a world with no walls or fences, who needs Windows and Gates?  :)

				I love science of all sorts.  I grew up on National Geographic documentaries, Astronomy Magazine, and watching any documentaries I could find on cable TV back in the day.

				I love my wife and children, my parents, and my brother and his family.  I feel very blessed that my children did not end up in a criminal lifestyle.  I am very proud of them both.  They are both schooled and working on lucrative careers.  My daughter, as a matter of fact, taught herself how to code.  She interned with a company that was later bought up by P&G while she was still interning there.  My son took up welding and has already impressed seasoned welders after only welding for 1 year so far!  :)

				I enlisted into the US Army back in 89 for Airborne Infantry Ranger.  Was stationed in Ft. Carson with the 4th ID, A. Co. 2/12 Infantry. While stationed there, I drove an armoured personnel carrier for 2 years and volunteered to fill a clerk position for a transitional period while my unit switched from the M113 APC to the new Bradley Fighting Vehicle APC.  My ETS (Exit the Service) date was in April of 93, with an Honorable Discharge.  I think I made my dad proud for that.  I come from a long line of military service.
