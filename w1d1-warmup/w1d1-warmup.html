    <p>"1. What is a Single-Page Application (SPA)?"</p>
    <p>"A web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of the browser loading entire new pages.  This is similar to a PDF that has a table of contents linking to different sections of the PDF but further down."</p>
    <p>"2. What is a Multi-Page Application (MPA)?"</p>
    <p>"A way to get back multiple HTML pages, where each page has content for given Router.  So one link will take you to another page, not a new location on the same page. "</p>
    <p>"3. When we built our Unit 2 apps, were they a SPA or MPA, why?"</p>
    <p>"SPA"</p>
    <p>"4. Give two pros of a SPA"</p>
    <p>"SPA can cache any local storage effectively. An application sends only one request, store all data, then it can use this data and works even offline."</p>
    <p>"SPAs are easy to debug with Chrome, as you can monitor network operations, investigate page elements and data associated with it."</p>
    <p>"5. Give two cons of a SPA"</p>
    <p>"It is slow to download because heavy client frameworks are required to be loaded to the client."</p>
    <p>"Compared to the “traditional” application, SPA is less secure. Due to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), it enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web application by other users."</p>
    <p>"6. Give two pros of a MPA"</p>
    <p>"It’s the perfect approach for users who need a visual map of where to go in the application. Solid, few level menu navigation is an essential part of traditional Multi-Page Application."</p>
    <p>"Very good and easy for proper SEO management. It gives better chances to rank for different keywords since an application can be optimized for one keyword per page."</p>
    <p>"7. Give two cons of a MPA"</p>
    <p>"Frontend and backend development are tightly coupled."</p>
    <p>"The development becomes quite complex. The developer needs to use frameworks for either client and server side. This results in the longer time of application development."</p>



    <p>"1. What were the three great technical accomplishments of MPL?"</p>
    <p>"First, it served as a crack team which understood the infrastructure of the site and could resolve small issues as they arose."</p>
    <p>"Second, it built an insurance application, called App2, which signed up new users in less than half the time of the original app."</p>
    <p>"Finally, it replaced the website’s crashy login system with a functional (and much less expensive) one of its own design."</p>
    <p>"2. What does 'API' stand for? *"</p>
    <p>"application programming interface"</p>
    <p>"3. What is an API? *"</p>
    <p>"A way for many sites to access the same database with different interfaces."</p>
